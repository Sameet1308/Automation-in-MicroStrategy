Incident Request – MicroStrategy Backtick Issue with Databricks Unity Catalog
Issue
MicroStrategy generates SQL with backticks around catalog, schema, table, and column names when querying Databricks Unity Catalog.
Example:
SELECT `col_a`
FROM `catalog`.`schema`.`orders`
Databricks does not accept backticks. We need MicroStrategy’s recommended way to disable backticks or switch to double quotes.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Connect MicroStrategy to Databricks Unity Catalog (JDBC).
2. Run a simple report.
3. View SQL – identifiers appear with backticks.
Impact
- Blocks reports using Unity Catalog tables.
- High severity (production integration blocked).

Request to Support
• Confirm which VLDB property controls quoting (Unified Quoting / Warehouse Identifier Quoting).
• Provide the correct value for Databricks UC (no quoting or double quotes).
• Clarify whether the change should be at Database Instance or Project level.
• Confirm if Intelligence Server restart is required.
Internal Change Draft
Proposed Change
- In Database Instance → VLDB Properties, adjust Unified Quoting Behavior for Warehouse Identifiers.
- Change from backticks to either No quoting or Double quotes.
- Apply at Database Instance level.

Test
- Run a report after change.
- Verify generated SQL uses correct quoting and executes in Databricks UC.

Rollback
- Revert VLDB setting to default (backticks).
- Restart Intelligence Server if required.
