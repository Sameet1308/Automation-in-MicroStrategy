As discussed, we are implementing a daily conversion process for CSV files that currently arrive in UTF-16 format and need to be converted to UTF-8 for downstream applications.

I am sharing with you the following artifacts for deployment and thorough testing in the DEV environment before promoting further:
	1.	PowerShell script (Convert-CsvUtf16ToUtf8.ps1) – Converts files safely with logging, retries, and lock handling.
	2.	Batch wrapper (run_convert_utf8.bat) – Calls the PowerShell script with parameters.
	3.	Sample AutoSys JIL – For scheduling on the Windows AutoSys agent.

⸻

Request
	•	Please deploy the script and batch file to the designated AutoSys Windows agent.
	•	Ensure the service account has Read/Write/Delete access to the shared folder and log folder.
	•	Run the job both manually (via batch file) and through AutoSys to validate.
	•	Capture evidence of test results (logs, file encoding before/after).

⸻

Test Plan
	1.	Place a sample UTF-16 CSV file (with non-ASCII characters) in the target folder.
	2.	Run the batch file directly → confirm conversion to UTF-8.
	3.	Schedule/trigger via AutoSys → confirm same behavior.
	4.	Re-run on an already converted file → should log “skipped” without corruption.
	5.	Verify logs at C:\AutoSys\logs\CsvUtfConvert.
	6.	Negative cases:
	•	No matching files → job exits with code 2 (no alarm expected).
	•	Locked file → retries, then clear error in logs.
	•	Permission issues → logged failure with non-zero exit code.

⸻

Troubleshooting Checklist
	•	Exit codes:
	•	0 = Success
	•	2 = No matching files
	•	10 = Conversion failure(s)
	•	20 = Shared path missing
	•	91 = Another instance running
	•	Common issues:
	•	Access denied → check share/NTFS permissions (Delete required).
	•	No logs → ensure local log folder exists with write permissions.
	•	AutoSys fails but manual works → confirm the agent’s service account.

Next Steps

Please complete testing in DEV and confirm once everything works as expected. After sign-off, we’ll proceed with higher environments.

Thanks for your support,
